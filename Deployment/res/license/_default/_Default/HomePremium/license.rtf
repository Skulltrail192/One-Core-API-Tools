If properly licensed, you have the right to use the version of the software installed during the installation process up to the time permitted for activation. \b Unless the software is activated, you have no right to use the software after the time permitted for activation.\b0  This is to prevent its unlicensed use. \b You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent activation.\b0  If the computer is connected to the Internet, the software may automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. If you do so, Internet and telephone service charges may apply. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require you to reactivate the software. \b The software will remind you to activate it until you do.\b0\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb120\sa120\tx360\b 5.\tab VALIDATION.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\sb120\sa120\tx720 a.\tab\b0 Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. It also verifies that no unauthorized changes have been made to the validation, licensing, or activation functions of the software. Validation may also check for certain malicious or unauthorized software related to such unauthorized changes. A validation check confirming that you are properly licensed permits you to continue to use the software, certain features of the software or to obtain additional benefits. \b You are not permitted to circumvent validation. \b0 This is to prevent unlicensed use of the software. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610.\par
\b b.\tab\b0 The software will from time to time perform a validation check of the software. The check may be initiated by the software or Microsoft. To enable the activation function and validation checks, the software may from time to time require updates or additional downloads of the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software. The updates or downloads are required for the proper functioning of the software and may be downloaded and installed without further notice to you. During or after a validation check, the software may send information about the software, the computer and the results of the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes, for example, the version and product key of the software, any unauthorized changes made to the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software, any related malicious or unauthorized software found and the Internet protocol address of the computer. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information.

\'b7\tab provide notices that the software is improperly licensed or a non-genuine Windows product\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\sb120\sa120\tx720 and you may\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li1080\sb120\sa120\tx1080\'b7\tab receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software, or\par
\'b7\tab need to follow Microsoft\rquote s instructions to be licensed to use the software and reactivate,\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\sb120\sa120\tx720 and you may not be able to\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li1080\sb120\sa120\tx1080\'b7\tab use or continue to use the software or some of the features of the software, or\par
\'b7\tab obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\sb120\sa120\tx360\b d.\tab\b0 You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612.\par

\'b7\tab\ul Digital Certificates\ulnone . The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over the Internet, when available.\par
\'b7\tab\ul Auto Root Update\ulnone . The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.\par
\'b7\tab\ul Windows Media Digital Rights Management\ulnone . Content owners use Windows Media digital rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-protected content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software\rquote s ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content. Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.\b\par
\b0\'b7\tab\ul Windows Media Player\ulnone . When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li1080\sb120\sa120\'b7\tab compatible online music services in your region; and\par

If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed and updated at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific information about Malware detected, errors, and other information about your computer. This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services. No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the software\rquote s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830.

\'b7\tab\ul Network Awareness\ulnone . This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.\par
\'b7\tab\ul Windows Time Service\ulnone . This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your computer with the correct time. You can turn this feature off or choose your preferred time source within the Date and Time Control Panel applet. The connection uses standard NTP protocol.\par
\'b7\tab\ul IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo)\ulnone . This feature helps existing home Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is next generation Internet protocol. It helps enable end-to-end connectivity often needed by peer-to-peer applications. To do so, each time you start up the software the Teredo client service\b\i  \b0\i0 will attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It does so by sending a query over the Internet. This query only transfers standard\b\i  \b0\i0 Domain Name Service information to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo service. If you\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li1080\sb120\sa120\'b7\tab use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity or\par
\'b7\tab configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity\par
by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals. No other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use non-Microsoft servers. You can also switch off this feature using a command line utility named \ldblquote netsh\rdblquote .\par
